// What will be logged in the first example and second example?

let var1;
console.log(var1);
// logs undefined as nothing is assigned to variable name
console.log(typeof var1);
// logs undefined
// undefined means the variable is declared but the value is not assigned yet inside this variable



let var2 = null;
console.log(var2);
// logs null and null is assigned to var2
console.log(typeof var2);
// logs obj as there is no type like null
